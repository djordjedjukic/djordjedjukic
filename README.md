### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who enjoys designing and implementing complex systems. With a strong software development and architecture background, I have successfully led numerous projects and contributed to developing complex systems that have transformed how businesses operate in various domains.

I am also the co-founder of "Imogen", an application with a mission to help companies to digitalize their business.

Continuous learning and growing as a developer motivated me to be an open-source contributor. I currently develop various ETLs for the RavenDB NoSql database.

Oh, and I changed the database on a project in production :)

If you want to discuss technology or need assistance with your software project, please contact me on LinkedIn. Alternatively, you can also email me at djukicdjole@gmail.com.
